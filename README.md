# Slot Machine Game

Welcome to my Second SwiftUI project - The Slot Machine Game.

With this project, i applied the same concepts as the first SwiftUI project and was able to develop a different game.

## The rules

You start with a set amount of points. Each spin costs 10 points. Each item has a differemt value, and if you match 3 of the same items, you'll gain points. If you reach 0, it's game over.

## Learning points.

- If else statements
- randomisation
- State
- variable types
- UI layout: stacks, spacers, controls and modifiers
